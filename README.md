# Final2019
A small turn-based fighting game made in Turtle.

Run 'main.py' to start the game.

Sound is functional for Windows, but may not work on other operating systems. 
If when turning on the music in settings the program crashes, 
  (1) you may need to go into the file named 'musicon.txt' and 
  (2) change the '1' to '0' so you can turn back off the music remotely.

The game only requires input with the mouse on the Settings page,
and anywhere else it only responds to keyboard input.
You can change what different keys do in Settings.

Directions are displayed on each page for what different keys do,
so if you are ever confused just look for any text with directions.
