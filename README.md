# Final2019
A small turn-based fighting game made in Turtle.

Run 'main.py' to start the game.

Sound is functional for Windows, but may not work on other operating systems. 
If running a different OS, use the [system-nonspecific](https://github.com/MalloryMiller/Alchimiae-Alogia/tree/system-nonspecific) branch. It won't have any music, but it'll run :)

The game only requires input with the mouse on the Settings page,
and anywhere else it only responds to keyboard input.
You can change what different keys do in Settings.

Directions are displayed on each page for what different keys do,
so if you are ever confused just look for any text with directions.

See the Credits to learn more about assets used.
